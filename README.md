# Tricko!
An open source app to manage turns adapted like a Gecko. In few words, what is Tricko? Tricko is like the gecko of the
tickets machine, because Tricko adapts to the necessities of those who take a ticket and to environment. Do you really
need a printed ticket? Althought Tricko doesn't work yet with printers, Tricko recommends to use the digital ticket to
save paper.
